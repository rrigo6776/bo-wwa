    <div class="first">They say to leave a mark behind... Well this is my mark. </div>
    <div class="second">Hi, my name's Rigo and honestly I don't expect a lot of people to stumble upon this website but if you're here, well I'm pleased to meet you and thank you for giving me the chance to be able to share my memories of my dog who's name is Bos. He passed away on June 4 of 2021, just a day before I graduated... </div>
    <div class="third">Some people don't know how much that doggo meant to me, some have an idea, and some actually understand... anyways, here I am. The following is a trail of memories from the beginning to the end, hopefully you guys stick around and get to experience the life of Bos for a little bit. Enjoy!</div>
